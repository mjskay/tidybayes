\title{Sample draws from a tidy-format data frame of draws}
\usage{
sample_draws(data, ndraws, draw = ".draw", seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame to sample from}

\item{ndraws}{The number of draws to return, or \code{NULL} to return all draws.}

\item{draw}{The name of the column indexing the draws; default \code{".draw"}.}

\item{seed}{A seed to use when subsampling draws (i.e. when \code{ndraws} is not \code{NULL}).}
}
\description{
Given a tidy-format data frame of draws with a column indexing each draw, subsample the data frame to a given size
based on a column indexing draws, ensuring that rows in sub-groups of a grouped data frame are sampled from the
same draws.
}
\details{
\code{sample_draws()} makes it easier to sub-sample a grouped, tidy-format data frame of draws. On a grouped data frame,
the naive approach of using \code{filter} with the \code{.draw} column will give incorrect results as it will
select a different sample within each group. \code{sample_draws()} ensures the same sample is selected within
each group.
